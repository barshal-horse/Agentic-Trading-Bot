    "action": "HOLD",
    "confidence": "MEDIUM",
    "reason": "The news surrounding Apple presents a mixed outlook. While the services segment shows continued growth and product sales are being driven by strategic discounts, the long-term competitive threat from OpenAI's potential AI-first hardware introduces significant uncertainty. This creates a balanced scenario where neither a strong buy nor a strong sell signal is present. Given that we currently hold AAPL, and the signals are mixed, holding is the most balanced decision at this time.",
